# 🛠️ Critical Fixes Applied

## Overview
Fixed major issues causing Unity Error status and server database errors.

## 🎯 Problem 1: Unity 404 Errors
**Issue**: Unity client getting 404 errors due to double slash in URLs
**Root Cause**: URL configuration had trailing slashes + code added slashes
**Fix**: Removed trailing slashes from all URL constants in `main.cs`

**Before:**
```csharp
public static string PlayerUrl = "https://renderfin.com/api-game-player/";
```
**After:**
```csharp
public static string PlayerUrl = "https://renderfin.com/api-game-player";
```

**Result**: Unity now sends requests to correct URLs without double slashes.

## 🎯 Problem 2: Database UNIQUE Constraint Errors
**Issue**: `SQLite Error 19: 'UNIQUE constraint failed: MatchQueues.UserId'`
**Root Cause**: Race conditions and poor synchronization between `user.IsInQueue` and `MatchQueues` table
**Fix**: Improved queue join logic in `QueueController.cs`

**Changes:**
- Removed unreliable `user.IsInQueue` check before database query
- Made `MatchQueues` table the single source of truth
- Added try-catch for race condition handling
- Improved error logging and user feedback

## 🎯 Problem 3: Players Stuck in "Match 0"
**Issue**: Players showing `CurrentMatchId = 0` instead of null or proper match ID
**Root Cause**: `CurrentMatchId` assigned before `SaveChangesAsync()` when auto-increment ID was still 0
**Fix**: Reordered operations in `MatchmakingService.cs`

**Before:**
```csharp
context.GameMatches.Add(match);
player.User.CurrentMatchId = match.MatchId; // MatchId = 0 here!
await context.SaveChangesAsync();
```

**After:**
```csharp
context.GameMatches.Add(match);
await context.SaveChangesAsync(); // Now MatchId gets proper value
player.User.CurrentMatchId = match.MatchId; // MatchId = proper ID
await context.SaveChangesAsync();
```

**Applied to:**
- 1v1 matches
- 2v2 matches  
- 4-player FFA matches

## 🎯 Problem 4: Error Status Recovery
**Issue**: Unity stuck in Error status even when server recovers
**Fix**: Added automatic recovery logic in `Lobby.cs`

**Features:**
- Detects when server becomes responsive again
- Automatically resets from Error to Idle status
- Improved error logging with emoji indicators
- Better user feedback

## 🎯 Problem 5: User Not Found Auto-Recovery
**Issue**: Unity gets stuck when user is deleted from server database but cached in Unity
**Fix**: Added automatic user recovery system in `Lobby.cs`

**Features:**
- Detects 404 "User not found" errors automatically
- Clears cached PlayerPrefs data
- Automatically re-registers new developer user
- Seamless recovery without user intervention
- Applied to heartbeat and match status checks
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

**Implementation:**
```csharp
// Helper function for auto-recovery
private bool TryAutoRecoverUserNotFound(UnityWebRequest request, string context = "")
{
    if (request.responseCode == 404 && 
        request.downloadHandler.text.Contains("не найден"))
    {
        PlayerPrefs.DeleteAll();
        currentUser = null;
        StartCoroutine(InitializePlayer());
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

## 🧹 Database Cleanup
Created `cleanup_db.ps1` script to fix existing stuck players:
- Clears players with `CurrentMatchId = 0`
- Resets queue status for all players
- Clears match queue table
- Provides cleanup statistics

## 🚀 Results
✅ **Unity Error Status**: Fixed - proper URL handling and automatic recovery
✅ **Database Errors**: Fixed - robust queue management without conflicts
✅ **Match 0 Issues**: Fixed - proper match ID assignment
✅ **User Not Found Recovery**: Fixed - automatic detection and re-registration
✅ **System Stability**: Improved - better error handling and recovery

## 🔧 Usage
1. **Unity**: Restart Unity to apply URL fixes
2. **Server**: Restart server to apply database fixes
3. **Database**: Run `cleanup_db.ps1` to clean existing stuck players

## 📊 Impact
- Unity client should connect successfully without 404 errors
- Server should handle queue operations without database conflicts
- Players should properly join/leave matches without getting stuck
- System should auto-recover from temporary network issues
- Players should automatically re-register when not found on server
- Development and testing workflow should be seamless with database resets

## 🎮 Next Steps
1. Test Unity connection with fixed URLs
2. Verify queue operations work smoothly
3. Test automatic user recovery system
4. Monitor server logs for any remaining issues
5. Consider adding more defensive programming for edge cases

## 🧪 Testing the Auto-Recovery System
To test the new automatic recovery:
1. Start Unity client and verify user registration
2. Note the user ID from logs (e.g., "User 380")
3. Delete user from server database (or restart server with clean DB)
4. Wait for heartbeat cycle (30 seconds) or trigger match check
5. Verify automatic recovery in Unity logs:
   ```
   [Lobby] 🔧 User not found during heartbeat! Auto-recovering...
   [Lobby] 🔄 Starting automatic re-registration during heartbeat...
   ```
6. Confirm new user is registered and system works normally
